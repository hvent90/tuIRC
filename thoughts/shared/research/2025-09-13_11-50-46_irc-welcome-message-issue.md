# Research: IRC welcome message not appearing on server connection

**Date**: 2025-09-13T11:50:46-07:00
**Researcher**: opencode
**Git Commit**: 861873d152a374cdbf2d99939e0d387d991ba333
**Branch**: main
**Repository**: irc-tui

## Research Question
When connecting to an IRC server, normally you are greeted with a large welcome message. That is not appearing.

## Summary
The IRC welcome messages (IRC commands 001-005: RPL_WELCOME, RPL_YOURHOST, RPL_CREATED, RPL_MYINFO, RPL_ISUPPORT) are not being displayed to users. The root cause is in the `handleSystem` function in `src/hooks/useIrcClient.ts` where system messages are only added to existing channels. Since welcome messages arrive immediately after connection but before joining any channels, they are lost and never displayed.

## Detailed Findings

### IRC Client Architecture
- **Core Implementation**: `src/lib/IrcClient.ts` handles TCP socket connections and IRC protocol parsing
- **Message Processing**: `src/lib/IrcParser.ts` parses raw IRC messages into structured format
- **React Integration**: `src/hooks/useIrcClient.ts` bridges EventEmitter-based client with React state management
- **UI Components**: `src/components/MessageArea.tsx` and `src/components/MessageItem.tsx` handle message display

### Welcome Message Processing Flow
1. **Connection**: User connects via `ConnectionDialog.tsx` → `IRCApp.handleConnect()` → `useIrcClient.connect()`
2. **Server Response**: IRC server sends welcome messages (commands 001-005) immediately after authentication
3. **Message Handling**: `IrcClient.processMessage()` routes welcome messages as "system" events
4. **Display Logic**: `useIrcClient.handleSystem()` attempts to add messages to channels
5. **Issue**: No channels exist yet, so welcome messages are discarded

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Primary Issue: Welcome Messages Lost When No Channels Exist
**Location**: `src/hooks/useIrcClient.ts:34-58`
**Problem**: The `handleSystem` function maps over existing channels to add system messages:
```typescript
setChannels(prev => {
  return prev.map(channel => {  // If prev is empty, returns empty array
    // ... system message creation logic
  })
})
```
**Impact**: Welcome messages (001-005) arrive before any channels are joined, so they are never displayed.

#### Secondary Issue: System Message Display Logic Flaw
**Location**: `src/hooks/useIrcClient.ts:37-39`
**Problem**: When `target` is undefined (as with welcome messages), the condition `if (target && channel.name !== target)` evaluates to false, causing system messages to be added to ALL channels.
**Impact**: If channels exist, welcome messages would appear in every channel tab.

### Code References
- `src/lib/IrcClient.ts:178-184` - Welcome message processing (commands 001-005)
- `src/hooks/useIrcClient.ts:34-58` - System message handling logic (root cause)
- `src/hooks/useIrcClient.ts:37-39` - Channel targeting logic flaw
- `src/components/MessageArea.tsx:17-46` - Message streaming implementation

### Architecture Insights
- **Event-Driven Design**: IRC client uses EventEmitter pattern for loose coupling
- **State Management**: React hooks manage connection state and channel data
- **Message Streaming**: Artificial typing effect for incoming messages (32ms intervals)
- **Connection Management**: Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff (up to 5 attempts)

### Open Questions
- Should welcome messages be displayed in a dedicated "Server" or "Status" channel?
- How should the message streaming behavior be consistent between system and user messages?
- Are there other system messages that might be affected by the same issue?

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate Fix**: Modify `handleSystem` to handle messages when no channels exist (display in a default channel or create a temporary status channel)
2. **Long-term**: Consider creating a dedicated server/status channel for system messages and welcome information
3. **Consistency**: Ensure system messages follow the same streaming/display patterns as user messages
